<h1 align="center"> Third-Year-Project </h1>

For my final third year project, I created a design guide for a space habitat for 30 habitants. This involved analysing certain aspects of the space habitat. Firstly, finding a favourable orbit for our mission. Secondly, a fitting design in shape and size. Thirdly, what materials we would use? Then how it would be constructed, overall design and cost. Finally verifying these aspects with a python orbital simulation calculating how many burns would be needed to keep this habitat in orbit.
